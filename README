== Blacklight OAI Demo

Blacklight OAI Demo demonstrates features from Blacklight ( http://projectblacklight.org )
and provides an out-of-the-box OAI-PMH harvestor ( http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/ )
for aggregating and indexing records.

Blacklight is open source discovery software. Libraries (or anyone else) can use Blacklight to enable searching and browsing of their collections online. Blacklight uses the Apache SOLR ( lucene.apache.org/solr ) search engine to index and search full text and/or metadata, and Blacklight has a highly configurable Ruby on Rails front-end.

== Getting Started

1. At the command prompt, clone this repository. Ex: git clone git://github.com/cbeer/blacklight-oai-demo.git
2. Change directory into blacklight-oai-demo and pull in the submodules: <tt>git submodule init && git submodule update</tt> 
3. Start the jetty server to start solr: <tt>JETTY_HOME=jetty jetty/jetty.sh</tt>
4. Start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get the Blacklight landing pae
6. Configure your OAI-PMH providers at http://localhost:3000/providers
7. Run -- manually or through a Cronjob -- <tt>rake oai:harvest</tt> to automatically harvest records

== Description of Contents

app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController
  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.

app/models
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.

app/views
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby
  syntax.

app/views/layouts
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common
  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the
  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,
  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.

app/helpers
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated
  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to
  wrap functionality for your views into methods.

config
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.

db
  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all
  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.

doc
  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated
  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>

lib
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't
  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.

public
  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,
  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be
  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.

public/xslt
  Contains example XSL transforms from OAI-PMH harvested records to the Solr document schema

script
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.

test
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template
  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.

text/fixtures
  Contains an example OAI Provider (from the Library of Congress)

vendor
  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.
  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.
  This directory is in the load path.

vendor/plugins/blacklight
  The Blacklight engine plugin
